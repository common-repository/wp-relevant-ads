WP Relevant Ads helps you display Ads based on your content terms (categories, tags, etc..) to make them relevant to your audience.
You have granular control over when and where each Ad should be displayed.

As an example, on as 'Sports' related blog you could display 'Sports' related Ads on posts categorized as 'Sports'. Or, you could display targeted Ads based on specific sports terms (baseball, soccer, etc..)

The same example can be used to any other type of blog. The Free version of the plugin is limited to posts taxonomies (post categories, post tags, etc...) but through paid add-ons you can display Ads on any custom content types taxonomies (WooCommerce products, classified listings, etc..).

With this type of control your Ad space instantly becomes more valuable since you can sell targeted Ads in specific categories.

Additionally, you can set specific Ads as 'Call to Action' Ads. These can be used to sell Ad space while the slot is not occupied by a regular Ad.

Displaying relevant Ads is as easy as choosing the terms that should trigger each Ad and how to display them (Shortcode or Widget).

Since Ads are as flexible as regular posts, which can have any content: image, video, text, etc.., you are not limited to use them as Ads.
You can easily use it to display any special content that you want to show on posts with specific terms.

Additional features include:
- Widget with grid layout and option to set the minimum Ads to display (if you don't have enough Ads to show, call to action Ads are displayed instead - if available)
- Set Ads expiring dates
- Define CSS styles/classes for each Ad
- Choose wether to display multiple Ads vertically (stacked) or horizontally (inline)
- Simple Ad sales contact form shortcode
- Detailed guided tutorial
- Caching mechanisms for displaying Ads

More features are available through paid add-ons. Visit the [official site](https://wprelevantads.com/add-ons) for more info or check the 'Add-ons' page on the plugin menu.
